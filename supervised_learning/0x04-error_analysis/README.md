# 0x04. Error Analysis

## Description
What you should learn from this project:

* What is the confusion matrix?
* What is type I error? type II?
* What is sensitivity? specificity? precision? recall?
* What is an F1 score?
* What is bias? variance?
* What is irreducible error?
* What is Bayes error?
* How can you approximate Bayes error?
* How to calculate bias and variance
* How to create a confusion matrix

### [0. Create Confusion](./0-create_confusion.py)
* Write the function def create_confusion_matrix(labels, logits): that creates a confusion matrix:


### [1. Sensitivity](./1-sensitivity.py)
* Write the function def sensitivity(confusion): that calculates the sensitivity for each class in a confusion matrix:


### [2. Precision](./2-precision.py)
* Write the function def precision(confusion): that calculates the precision for each class in a confusion matrix:


### [3. Specificity](./3-specificity.py)
* Write the function def specificity(confusion): that calculates the specificity for each class in a confusion matrix:


### [4. F1 score](./4-f1_score.py)
* Write the function def f1_score(confusion): that calculates the F1 score of a confusion matrix:


### [5. Dealing with Error](./5-error_handling)
* In the text file 5-error_handling, write the lettered answer to the question of how you should approach the following scenarios. Please write the answer to each scenario on a different line. If there is more than one way to approach a scenario, please use CSV formatting and place your answers in alphabetical order (ex. A,B,C):


### [6. Compare and Contrast](./6-compare_and_contrast)
* Given the following training and validation confusion matrices and the fact that human level performance has an error of ~14%, determine what the most important issue is and write the lettered answer in the file 6-compare_and_contrast
