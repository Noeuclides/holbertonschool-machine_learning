# 0x01. Multiclass Classification

## Description
What you should learn from this project:

* What is multiclass classification?
* What is a one-hot vector?
* How to encode/decode one-hot vectors
* What is the softmax function and when do you use it?
* What is cross-entropy loss?
* What is pickling in Python?

---

### [0. One-Hot Encode](./0-one_hot_encode.py)
* Write a function def one_hot_encode(Y, classes): that converts a numeric label vector into a one-hot matrix:


### [1. One-Hot Decode](./1-one_hot_decode.py)
* Write a function def one_hot_decode(one_hot): that converts a one-hot matrix into a vector of labels:


### [2. Persistence is Key](./2-deep_neural_network.py)
* Update the class DeepNeuralNetwork (based on 23-deep_neural_network.py):


### [3. Update DeepNeuralNetwork](./3-deep_neural_network.py)
* Update the class DeepNeuralNetwork to perform multiclass classification (based on 2-deep_neural_network.py):


### [4. All the Activations](./4-deep_neural_network.py)
* Update the class DeepNeuralNetwork to allow different activation functions (based on 3-deep_neural_network.py):
