### [0. Initialize Gaussian Process ](./0-gp.py)
* represents a noiseless 1D Gaussian process.
Using dot product distance method:
![euclidean distance dot product method](https://github.com/noeuclides/holbertonschool-machine_learning/blob/master/unsupervised_learning/0x03-hyperparameter_tuning/img/distance_dot_product.png?raw=true)

### [1. Gaussian Process Prediction ](./1-gp.py)
* predicts the mean and standard deviation of points in a Gaussian process.

### [2. Update Gaussian Process ](./2-gp.py)
* update the class GaussianProcess.

### [3. Initialize Bayesian Optimization ](./3-bayes_opt.py)
* performs Bayesian optimization on a noiseless 1D Gaussian process.
