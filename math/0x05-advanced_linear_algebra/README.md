# 0x05. Advanced Linear Algebra

## Description
What you should learn from this project:

* What is a determinant? How would you calculate it?
* What is a minor, cofactor, adjugate? How would calculate them?
* What is an inverse? How would you calculate it?
* What are eigenvalues and eigenvectors? How would you calculate them?
* What is definiteness of a matrix? How would you determine a matrixâ€™s definiteness?

### [0. Determinant](./0-determinant.py)
* Write a function def determinant(matrix): that calculates the determinant of a matrix.


### [1. Minor](./1-minor.py)
* Write a function def minor(matrix): that calculates the minor matrix of a matrix.


### [2. Cofactor](./2-cofactor.py)
* Write a function def cofactor(matrix): that calculates the cofactor matrix of a matrix.


### [3. Adjugate](./3-adjugate.py)
* Write a function def adjugate(matrix): that calculates the adjugate matrix of a matrix.


### [4. Inverse](./4-inverse.py)
